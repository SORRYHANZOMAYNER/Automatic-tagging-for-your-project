# Automatic-tagging-for-your-project 
this is a script for automatically tagging git commits,
an example of the input line for the repository is specified in the project, 
the type of tag can be changed on line 72 and from 56 to 60, 
to create a change log, you need to change the path to the text file on line 47 and create the file itself. 
this is my first small working project, don't scold too much)
